Hello everyone,

I hope you are excited for our upcoming JBoss EAP migration workshop! Before the workshop, please do the following:

1. Your Azure Pass code is **XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX**. Go to the [Azure Pass site](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/) to redeem your code, which will create a new Azure Subscription. 
2. Go to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/workshop-migrate-jboss-on-app-service) and make a fork of it in your personal GitHub account.
3. Follow the [instructions on this page](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/workshop-migrate-jboss-on-app-service/blob/main/instructions/0-environment-setup.md) to create a GitPod cloud development environment, which will be pre-configured with everything you need for the workshop.
4. On the night before the workshop, [deploy this template]() to create a few big resources that we will need later in the workshop.

Contact me if you have any questions!

Best,
<your-name-here>
